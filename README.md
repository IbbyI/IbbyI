## **About Me**

I am a Python-focused backend developer with a strong interest in:

* **Systems programming and file operations**
* **API design using Django REST Framework**
* **Software architecture and modular code organization**
* **Reliability, testing, and code maintainability**
* **Performance-oriented programming (profiling, optimization, hashing)**

My approach emphasizes **clarity**, **predictability**, and **engineering discipline**.
I build real tools and structure code the way it would be written in a production environment.

## **Highlighted Project: Deduplicate**

A fully modular, production-quality command-line utility for detecting and managing duplicate files at scale.

**Repository:** [https://github.com/IbbyI/Deduplicate](https://github.com/IbbyI/Deduplicate)

### **Key Technical Features**

* Full, quick, and adaptive hashing strategies (SHA-256)
* Recursive file system scanning with exclusion rules
* Duplicate grouping & selection logic (timestamp-based)
* Clean architecture: **core logic**, **UI layer**, and **CLI interface**
* Verbosity system implemented with decorators
* Rich TUI integration (progress bars, confirmations)
* Move / delete actions with dry-run support
* Extensive **unit test coverage** (filesystem ops, hashing, comparison, logging)
* Designed for packaging (`pipx` / entry points)

### **Engineering Depth**

* Time & memory profiling for optimization
* Stateless pure functions in core modules
* Separation of concerns across packages
* Strong emphasis on predictability and safety (e.g., dry-run mode, confirmation prompts)
